# reason-maintenance
Towards a Modern Truth-Maintenance System and Inference Engine

This stub shows how to translate from the basics of the Truth-Maintenance System (TMS) as presented in the book [Building Problem Solvers](https://github.com/namin/biohacker/tree/master/BPS) to an SMT solver.
In particular, the [tests](https://github.com/metareflection/reason-maintenance/blob/main/reason_tests.py) show code very similar to the [basic TMS examples](https://github.com/namin/biohacker/blob/master/BPS/jtms/jtms-ex.lisp).

Missing from this stub is incrementality of the encoded engine.
